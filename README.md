##  Artificial Neural Network Classifier 
###  Predict a student performance 
This neural network will model an one input layer (three nodes 𝑥1, 𝑥2 and b or 𝜃0), with single hidden layer (four nodes) and one output (one node). The output of the neural network model will be predicting the score of test mark based on the inputs of studying hours and sleeping hours per week.
